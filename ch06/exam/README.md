## SHORT DESCRIPTION *(1 or 2 sentences describing your program)*
    My program is using the turtle and random module to draw a flower. It regenerates a random number of petals to draw and uses a function and for loop to create the shape.
## KNOWN BUGS AND INCOMPLETE PARTS *(list any known bugs or non-working parts)*
    All the parts of the program should be functioning.
## REFERENCES *(any resources you use outside of class materials)*
    I looked at a few existing programs to get an idea of what needs to be done. For example, I looked at a GeeksforGeeks article on drawing a flower.
## MISCELLANEOUS COMMENTS *(anything else you would like the grader to know)*
